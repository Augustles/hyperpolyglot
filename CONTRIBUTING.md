# CONTRIBUTING

If you see an error or a gap in http://hyperpolyglot.org that you want to see fixed,
you can send an email to hpglot@gmail.com

We are also making the markup available on GitHub for people who want to submit
pull requests.  The markup is the style used by http://wikidot.com.  I'm not aware of
any available command line tools for converting this markup to HTML.  The way to
see your changes rendered is to create an account on http://wikidot.com and upload the markup.
